# Project Update: Web App Architecture Completed & ML/NLP Models in Development

## Web App Architecture

âœ… **Core Components Implemented:**
- Web Framework: Remix
- Database: Distributed SQLite with LiteFS
- ORM: Prisma
- Authentication: Email/Password with cookie-based sessions
- Frontend: React with Radix UI components and Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js
- Testing: Playwright (E2E), Vitest (Unit)
- Deployment: Fly.io
- Monitoring: Grafana 

âœ… **Additional Technologies Integrated:**
- Healthcheck endpoint for server backups region fallbacks
- GitHub Actions/Bitbucket Piplelines for CI/CD
- Progressively Enhanced and fully type-safe forms with Conform
- Custom-built image hosting
- Caching via cachified (in-memory and SQLite-based with better-sqlite3)
- End-to-end testing with Playwright
- Local third-party request mocking with MSW
- Code formatting with Prettier
- Linting with ESLint
- Static Types with TypeScript
- Runtime schema validation with zod

- Account page: creemson.com/account
- Beta Versions: creemson.com/beta
- Project story: creemson.com/keynote
- Beta version reports: creemson.com/reports

## ML/NLP Models

### Version 1 (Documentation in Progress) âœ…
ðŸ”„ **Current Focus:**
- Python-based intent classification model
- Integration with core stack via API endpoints
- Libraries: spaCy, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- Pre-trained models: BERT, RoBERTa

**Key Features:**
- [ ] Machine learning-based genre classification
- [ ] Basic automated attribute detection
- [ ] Simple unit and numeric value parsing

**Documentation Status:**
- [ ] Model architecture
- [ ] Integration process with web app
- [ ] Initial performance metrics
- [ ] Known limitations and areas for improvement

### Version 2 (Planned)
ðŸ”œ **Planned Enhancements:**
- Improved attribute detection and mapping
- Enhanced semantic search capabilities
- Integration of more advanced NLP techniques

### Version 3 (Future Roadmap)
ðŸ”® **Potential Features:**
- Advanced context understanding
- Self-improving models based on user feedback

## Next Steps:
1. Complete Version 1 ML/NLP model documentation
2. Begin implementation of Version 2 ML/NLP model enhancements
3. Continue development of core web app functionality
4. Review and finalize coding standards for both web app and ML/NLP components
5. Define branch naming conventions and code review process
6. Set up scheduled maintenance windows

## Notes:
- The project is following Agile methodology with 2-day sprint cycles
- Daily progress updates will be added to the Beta Process Documentation with Tsuruta-san initially. 
- Team knowledge sharing sessions are planned to ensure all members are aligned on the project's progress across both web app and ML/NLP components
